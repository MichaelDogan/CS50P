My repository for the Harvard University CS50P Course - Introduction to Programming with Python

https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with and without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Plus exceptions and debugging; unit tests; libraries; file I/O; regular expressions; and classes, objects, methods, and properties. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.
